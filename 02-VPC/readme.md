This Terraform project creates a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) named my-app-vpc in Google Cloud Platform to support a multi-tier web application. It uses a reusable module (module/VPC) to define the VPC, ensuring modularity and scalability. Three subnets (web-subnet-us, db-subnet-us, web-subnet-eu) are dynamically created across two regions using the for_each meta-argument. Firewall rules allow HTTP traffic (port 80) for web-tagged instances and conditional SSH access (port 22) for management-tagged instances using count. A data source queries the default GCP network’s ID for reference. Local values format output messages for clarity. Outputs display the VPC ID, subnet IDs, firewall rule names, and default network ID. The configuration is stored in a Git repository (terraform-gcp-vpc) with a clear file structure. Root files (02-VPC) manage variables and module calls, while the module handles resource creation. This project demonstrates Terraform best practices like modularity, dynamic resources, and output formatting.
