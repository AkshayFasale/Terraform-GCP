# This Terraform project creates a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) named my-app-vpc in Google Cloud Platform to support a multi-tier web application. It uses a reusable module (module/VPC) to define the VPC, ensuring modularity and scalability. Three subnets (web-subnet-us, db-subnet-us, web-subnet-eu) are dynamically created across two regions using the for_each meta-argument. Firewall rules allow HTTP traffic (port 80) for web-tagged instances and conditional SSH access (port 22) for management-tagged instances using count. A data source queries the default GCP networkâ€™s ID for reference. Local values format output messages for clarity. Outputs display the VPC ID, subnet IDs, firewall rule names, and default network ID. The configuration is stored in a Git repository (terraform-gcp-vpc) with a clear file structure. Root files (02-VPC) manage variables and module calls, while the module handles resource creation. This project demonstrates Terraform best practices like modularity, dynamic resources, and output formatting.
